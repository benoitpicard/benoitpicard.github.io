				<p>I am an energetic, skilful and creative mechanical engineer, graduated from a program focussed on product development. 
				I have genuine interests in renewable energy and automotive industry, especially for greener transportation. I also have 
				a fast and accurate understanding of physical phenomena, developed 
				through very diversified work experiences. I am looking forward to help your company developing 
				next-generation environmentally friendly technologies.</p>
				<p>Throughout 4 years of engine development and testing, twenty months of 
				internships and 4 years of successful extracurricular projects and, I have 
				developed relevant skills to product design, testing and 
				optimisation. My principal technical skills are in mechanical product 
				design and in engine instrumentation and testing, which includes 
				data analysis and controller calibration know-how.</p>
				<p>Hired within the Combustion, Performance 
				and Emissions (CPE) team at Westport Innovation, I have been primarily responsible of 
				engine testing, calibration and verification to meet the 
				products design requirement, including emission regulation. To 
				achieve those requirements, my primary activities were the 
				planning and management of engine tests in a dedicated test 
				cell, the analysis of test data for reporting results and 
				documenting components failure, and finally the calibration of specific 
				engine work packages assigned to me. <o:p></o:p></p>
				<p>I have also designed, build and operated two other engine test benches. One was for supersonic hydrogen powered 
				engine experiment on an <a href="R4E.html" class="hyperlink_green">R4E</a>, using Labview for controls and data acquisitions 
				and Matlab for data treatment and analysis. I also did FEA and CFD analysis on the 
				structural body of a <a href="SupermileageSAE.html"class="hyperlink_green">Supermileage</a> prototype car to achieve the 
				lightest and the most efficient monocoque shell. For the same 
				project, I did thermal studies on the internal 
				combustion spark engine of the car to choose the best suitable materials and 
				the optimum thermodynamic configuration. Those studies were 
				validated with real physical mechanisms on the second test bench I 
				worked on.</p>
				<p>I have been many times compared to a cyborg by my colleagues 
				because of my strong computer skills, and abilities 
				to learn quickly. I have learn to work with a large variety of 
				engineering programs from mechanical assisted software (CAD, CFD 
				and FEA) to calibration and analysis tools (matlab/simulink, ATi 
				Vision and CANalyzer). I handle very easily the complete Microsoft Office 
				programs, including Excel macros (Visual Basic), Access and Expression Web 
				(HTML5, CSS and Javascript). </p>
				<p>In fact I am a modest person, but you need to know that I 
				have always been among the best in what I did. I was nominated 
				team leader of two extracurricular design projects, which 
				allowed me to develop complementary skills in communication and 
				organization as I was leading teams of 15 future engineers 
				towards international competitions. I successfully lead teams of 
				2 different project (<a class="hyperlink_green" href="bajaSAE.html">Baja SAE</a> and 
				<a href="supermileageSAE.html" class="hyperlink_green">Supermileage SAE</a>) to obtain the 1<sup>st</sup> place at each respective 
				international competition involving 
				more than 70 North American universities. Innovation and quality 
				have always been the main focus in every aspects of my work, and 
				I am ready to turn new challenges into great success.</p>
